And just because I can, I also rebuilt popular home pages from 1998 such as Google, Angelfire, and AOL. Websites used to be so simple and straight forward, can we go back to that?

<div id="div4"><span></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br><h1 id="h1">DESIGNER</h1></span><p>I have been working as a designer for 11+ years. I received my BFA in graphic</br>
     design from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where I developed my </br>
     passion for typography. That passion drove me to what I wanted to pursue</br>
      professionally: designing for the web. Because the web is 99% text <span id="span1">(unverified üòÖ),</span></br>
       typography is the most important foundation of any given website. Picking</br>
        typefaces and typesetting are my first tasks when starting any web projects.</br></br>

    Many think that design is all about aesthetics, but a wise mentor once told me that</br>
     ‚Äúdesign is about solving problems, first and foremost‚Äù. My obsession of becoming a</br>
      true designer drove me to what I am today: designing for the accessible web. While</br>
       polished typographic styles create good forms, more is needed: functions. And more</br>
        importantly, the experience of said functions. I mull over the user experience of </br>
        every design I create, making sure they are usable, useful, and exclusive<br>
        <br><br><br>

      </br>
       <p>
        Regardless what you are designing, it is important to pick the right tool. For the </br>web, that tool is code.</br>

        What is better than working in the exact medium that you are designing for?</br>
         Nothing. That is the reason I learned to code. I see HTML and CSS as a design tool,</br>
         just like Adobe XD, Sketch, or Figma, but it is a tool that does not create a layer of </br>
        abstraction. If one can read and write HTML and CSS, one can fully understand the </br>
        limitations of the current web technologies. When equipped with such knowledge, </br>
        >a designer can easily rapid prototype designs that stay true to their intentions.</br>
         Great designers pay attention to the smallest details, and the right tool enables</br>
         them to massage the design as much as possible.</br></br>
        
        Not only do I design with code, I also design in the code. Semantics is a big deal on</br>
         the web, it leads to better performance, better accessibility, and better SEO. While </br>
        it is technically possible to build a website with just a bunch of <span id="span3">div>s‚Äîa generic</span> </br>
            element that carries no semantics, it is important to know that there are close to </br>
            100 HTML elements available for use. If a design has a specific information</br> 
            architecture visually, the same must be represented in code.</br>
